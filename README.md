# TestDrivenDevelopment

## Description 

I built this application with unit testing and test-driven development to understand TDD theory and practice, to write coherent tests that reveal the true weaknesses in code long before it ever goes to production.

Film Fest apps main feature is keeping track of movies we may want to see and checking off movies that we've already been to as time goes by. A single-view application with a table view. 
The table view has two sections, stores our movie objects, and when we select a movie from the first section, it just moves to the second section.
